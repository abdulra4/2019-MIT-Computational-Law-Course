## Short Description

Two competing approaches to our personal data-fueled economy are emerging. The first treats personal data as an asset capable of being transferred, traded, and commoditized through contract law (the "property approach”), while the second treats personal data as an extension of our identity, calling for a personal, non-transferable (i.e. inalienable), intrinsic right in our data (the “rights-based approach”). The pace of technological change is accelerating the urgency of picking an approach or determining whether they can coexist. The topic that I would like to explore is how we can design guiding principles to resolve this tension and pave a realistic path forward.
