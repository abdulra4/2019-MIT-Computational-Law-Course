# Legal Hackers 2019

By popular demand, we have added a session about the Legal Hackers international movement. The session will be led by Jameson Dempsey, the Global Organizer for Legal Hackers and Residential Fellow at CodeX, the Stanford Center for Legal Informatics. In this session, you will learn about the origins, mission, and growth of Legal Hackers. This session will also highlight some of the cool things that came out of the organization in 2019.
