## Example of a blockchain smart-contract for Digital Rights Management

The smart-contract is designed for Hyperledger Fabric platform:
https://www.hyperledger.org/projects/fabric

The code is implemented in Go language and has the following functions:

- createWallet – creates a new wallet for a participant
- createLicense – creates a new license
- searchForLicense – searches for all licenses based on criteria
- transferRights – transfers rights to another participant, calculates fees and updates balances in wallets

The smart-contract code is in the drm.go file.
The drm_test.go file contains a suite of tests of the smart-contract. These can be executed by the following command: “go test” on the folder.

The smart-contract can be deployed on both, a stand-alone or cloud-based instance of Fabric.

IBM operates Hyperledger Fabric based IBM Blockchain Platform within Bluemix cloud and offers a free Starter Plan to run blockchain networks:
